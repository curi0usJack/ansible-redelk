# Add Cobalt Strike team server IPs here. Note configure the filebeat_id
# appropriately for each teamserver. I've given examples. The filebeat_id
# is primarily used on the backend, but setting it here will help keep
# things straight if you have to troubleshoot.
#
# Example Value:
#
# [c2servers]
# 1.2.3.4 filebeat_id=c2server1
# 5.6.7.8 filebeat_id=c2server2
[c2servers]

# All redirector/proxy IPs here. The filebeat_id must also be included.
#
# Example Value:
#
# [redirectors]
# 2.3.4.5 filebeat_id=redir1
# 3.4.5.6 filebeat_id=redir2
[redirectors]

# Add the RedElk server IP here. THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE! Note, if you're
# using EC2 for your RedElk instance, it needs to be at minimum a t2.medium.
# A micro instance won't work well with the ELK stack.

# This is where you'd set the private keys for each of the groups. This
# will allow you to have combinations of on-prem vs cloud-based hosts.
# Note you must have sudo privs on these systems. Of course, the pem file
# can be named whatever you want, I just listed paths there as examples.
# Same with users.
